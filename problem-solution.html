              Global warming is driven mainly by human burning of coal, oil, and gas.
              Yet its harshest consequences fall first on low‑income communities,
              Indigenous peoples, and young people who contributed least to the crisis.

                  In 2024, global surface temperatures were about 1.46&nbsp;°C above the
                  1850–1900 average, making it the hottest year in modern records. The

            <p>
              Scientists track global warming using many indicators: atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>,
              long‑term temperature records, ocean heat content, and sea‑ice extent, among
              others. Together, they paint a clear picture: the planet is warming quickly,
              mostly because of human emissions.
            </p>
            
                2024 was the warmest year on record in NOAA and NASA datasets, with
                global surface temperatures around 1.46&nbsp;°C above the
                1850–1900 average.
                Upper‑ocean heat content reached new highs, as oceans absorb about 90%
                of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases.
                Antarctic sea‑ice extent hit some of its lowest recorded levels, while
                many regions experienced record heatwaves and floods.
              
            <p class="meta-note">
              These indicators are independently monitored by multiple research groups.
              Their agreement strengthens confidence in the evidence of human‑driven
              warming.
