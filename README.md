# Hack for Humanityb2026 Project
## Inspiration
I have already done a few environmental-based avocational websites, and I was already trying to develop more coding skills, which is why this was the perfect opportunity for me
## What it does
My website functions like a normal information site. There are minimum interactive elements, and itis built to inform users about the dangers of climate change, and how we can all work together to prevent it from worsening.
## How I built it
I built it using common languages HTML and CSS. As there were no other interactive elements than HTML buttons, I didn't use JavaScript.

## What we learned
Ironically, I learned more about the issue. I never knew these components that came with global warming, and it makes me more determined to be a helper in preventing this issue.
